named Bob goes to a market and
purchases a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. On his way home, Bob comes to
the bank of a river and rents a boat. But crossing the river by boat, Bob
could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat,
or the cabbage.
%
If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat
the cabbage.
%
Bob's challenge is to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of
the river, leaving each purchase intact. How does he do it?
