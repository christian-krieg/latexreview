\maketitle

Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and
a cabbage. On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented
a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself
and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.

If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would
eat the cabbage.

The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank
of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?
